- [ ] Fun and entertaining artwork or short comics to promote the project and educate people about how humanoids can be safe

### industrial-design

- [ ] Refine design language for a baseline anthro model (plastic covering version)
- [ ] Conceptualize some interesting variants and modifications to the anthro platform (centaurs, wheeled bases for torsos, flying platforms...)

## Marketing and Social media

### influencers

- [ ] Utilize as many platforms as possible to promote the project amongst all audiences ("robots for everyone")
