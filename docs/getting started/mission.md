# Mission

***TLDR: Develop, build, and ship hyper-affordable Anthroids. Repeat.***

## Who we are

We are Anthrobotics, a company based in Alberta, Canada.

## What we are doing

We are developing anthropomorphic robots (anthros), which we call ***Anthroids***.

These robots will serve as physical embodiments for unrestricted, independent, and creative synthetic intelligence.

## Why we are doing this

The ideal humanoid robot doesn't currently exist. That's why we are making them. Humanoid robots need to be extremely:

- **Safe**
- **Open**
- **Fun**
- **Affordable**
- **Evolving**

Anthroids are based on the human form, using biomimetic musculoskeletal designs for aesthetics and function. Designing humanoid robots to mimic the human body leads to a safer machine, and a less uncanny appearance.
The only way to make humanoid robots **truly safe**, is with organically-inspired designs - not with terminator-esque 'actuators on sticks' designs.

Anthroids are fully **open-source**. This is for several key reasons:

- Build trust, honesty, and transparency with people
- Respect privacy
- Democratize public access to humanoid robot technology
- Promote unrestricted AI development
- Facilitate and encourage community collaboration on developing robots and AI
- Give people an underdog alternative to building & buying robots, rather than from the 'big, bad corpos'

Anthroids shall be **fun, unique, and not boring**, by design. Other humanoid robots are typically faceless, devoid of personality and character, and are uncanny. We are forging a future where robots are as unique and varied as, if not more so, than humans.
There will be no limit or restriction on the creativity in the physical character design of Anthroids - a principle that will be further reflected in the synthetic intelligence they shall possess.

Anthroids shall be **the most hyper-affordable humanoid robots on Earth**. This will be achieved not only from the seamless scalability building of them, but due to their bio-inspired designs, which make them ridiculously simple to manufacture. The Anthroid will effectively eliminate the need for people to buy overpriced, underperforming, boring, and dangerous humanoids (and save them the buyer's remorse).

Anthroids will **continue to evolve and improve** as our technology does. Ultimately, we will move beyond purely electromechanical systems, and towards bio-synthetic ones. This will ensure the Anthroid will **never be obsolete**.

## How we will make an impact

When Anthroids start to ship, the effects will be immediate and noticeable. The distribution of the Anthroid will:

- Finally **provide a safe, friendly and capable** household humanoid robot
- **Threaten established competitors** and their intrinsically unsafe, 'terminator'-style humanoids
- **Democratize** biomimetic humanoid robots for all
- Solve the staffing and retention issues in industries critical to **security and stability**
- Solve the loneliness epidemic, and **provide companionship to billions** of individuals
- Secure **humanity's succession** plan

## Our future

The Anthro project is just the beginning of our work in creating intelligent agents that will exist alongside humans - and not replace them.
