Welcome to the Anthro Docs site.

Here you will find documentation on our Anthro project, how to get involved, and more.

Let's build the fun & friendly future of open-source robotics together.

See our [mission](getting%20started/mission.md), our [goals](roadmap/project%20goals.md), and ongoing [tasks](progress%20tracker/hardware%20progress.md).

## Contributing

We welcome you to join us on our endeavor of bringing embodied synthetic intelligence (SI) of all forms to everyone.

If you want to help, please see the [Getting Started](getting%20started/roles%20%26%20positions.md) section to see how you can be part of the most important robotics project of our time.

## Requirements 

We've built some guidelines for the project. See the [requirements](requirements/requirements%20and%20guidelines%20overview.md) section for more details.
