## Intro
A list of ongoing design and aesthetics-related tasks yet to be started, in-progress, and completed.

Tasks will be tracked in more detail on GitHub. This page is updated to reflect the overall states of tasks.

*Note: This list is by no means, finalized. Tasks will be added, removed, and reordered on a rolling basis.*

## Task progress

- [ ] Design and develop anatomically correct prosthetic components 
- [ ] Embed prosthetic components with soft electronics and tactile sensors
- [ ] Integrate prosthetic components into endoskeleton hardware
- [ ] Integrate animation / emotion display into faceplates (facial expressions)
- [ ] Design exoskeleton components with the hardware team using artificial muscles 
- [ ] Design a form-fit fursuit system to match the endoskeleton
- [ ] Ensure fursuit compatibility with prosthetic components 
- [ ] Design a form-fit plastic covering system for the endoskeleton
- [ ] Design an armored covering system for the endoskeleton
- [ ] No covering system has any pinch-points or sharp edges
- [ ] All covering systems are water-resistant and protected against dust and debris
- [ ] Armored covering: integrated heatsinks for electronics and drive systems
- [ ] Plastic covering: filtered mesh ventilation for air-cooling
- [ ] Fursuit covering: filtered mesh ventilation for air-cooling
- [ ] Faceplate variants for fursuit models can be swapped out
- [ ] Coverings for all variants are modular, serviceable for repair, and washable
- [ ] Create emotes and stickers for Discord server
- [ ] Create anthro mascot for the project, and company mascot
- [ ] Rework logo for the anthro project 
- [ ] Concept artwork to promote the project
- [ ] References for initial "cast" of robot characters to promote the project (to be built as IRL robots)
- [ ] Fun and entertaining artwork or short comics to promote the project and educate people about how humanoids can be safe
- [ ] Refine design language for a baseline anthro model (plastic covering version)
- [ ] Conceptualize some interesting variants and modifications to the anthro platform (centaurs, wheeled bases for torsos, flying platforms...)
