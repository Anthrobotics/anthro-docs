# Hardware Progress

## Intro
A list of ongoing hardware-related tasks yet to be started, in-progress, and completed.

Tasks will be tracked in more detail on GitHub. This page is updated to reflect the overall states of tasks.

*Note: This list is by no means, finalized. Tasks will be added, removed, and reordered on a rolling basis.*
