# Requirements

In this section, we cover the requirements set out for the development, building, and shipping of Anthros. We also provide explanations for why such requirements are necessary for this project.

For a humanoid robot to be considered an anthro, it must satisfy the following conditions.

## Accessibility

- All design files, software, firmware, and documentation must be open-source under both CC BY-SA-NC 4.0 and Humanthro licenses. This ensures that information remains accessible to the public, developers and authors are properly credited for contributions, and remixing of files and designs for personal, educational or research purposes is allowed.
- Nothing can be patented. Everything shall remain available for non-commercial  personal, educational or research purposes. Commercial licensing is available. We will not patent materials, not allow patenting, as they stifle and inhibit freely accessible innovation for all. 


## Design 

- They must be musculoskeletal, safe, and compliant. Robots with high-inertia designs are dangerous, and generally heavier. Humans evolved to have a great musculoskeletal system. Anthros will have them too.
- They must be customizable to take on any anthropomorphic appearance. Too many humanoid robots are boring, and lack soul and character. Anthros will be unique and infinitely varied in appearance, personality and identity. Nothing is off the table here - from classic humanoid robot designs, to furry characters - all will be made possible.
- Everything SHALL be designed using software that is:
    - open-source, and free for commercial use; or is
    - licensed for commercial use.
- All hardware must be producible on consumer-grade equipment, using publically-available manufacturing services, or sourced from approved and/or official vendors.
