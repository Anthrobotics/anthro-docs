# Accessibility Requirements

## Accessibility

- ***All design files, software, firmware, and documentation must be open-source under appropriate licenses***. This ensures that information remains accessible to the public, developers and authors are properly credited for contributions, and remixing of files and designs for personal, educational or research purposes is allowed. The licenses are as follows:
    - **Hardware and Design Files** - **[CERN-OHL-S v2](https://ohwr.org/cern_ohl_s_v2.pdf)**
    - **Software and Firmware** - **[MIT](https://opensource.org/license/mit)**
    - **Documentation** - **[CC BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/)**
- ***Nothing can be patented***. Everything shall remain available for personal, educational or research purposes. Commercial use will be allowed. Patents stifle and inhibit freely accessible innovation for all, and go against the very principles of open-source work. 
- ***Project files, documentation, and downloads will all be served through GitHub.*** Alternate hosting locations for files will be determined.
