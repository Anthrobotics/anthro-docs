# Design Requirements

## Design 

- ***They must be musculoskeletal, safe, and compliant***. Robots with high-inertia designs are dangerous, and generally heavier. Humans evolved to have a great musculoskeletal system. Anthros will have them too.
- ***They must be customizable to take on any anthropomorphic appearance***. Too many humanoid robots are boring, and lack soul and character. Anthros will be unique and infinitely varied in appearance, personality and identity. Nothing is off the table here - from classic humanoid robot designs, to furry & scalie characters - all will be made possible.
- ***Everything shall be designed using software that is***:
    - open-source, and free for commercial use; or is
    - licensed for commercial use.
- ***Hardware design software must support assemblies***.
Examples of recommended software for hardware design includes:
    - Onshape
    - FreeCAD
Onshape is what we use, primarily due to it's seamless integration with the extensions created by K-Scale labs for URDF generation.
